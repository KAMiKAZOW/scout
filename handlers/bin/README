ABOUT

The "command not found" message is not very helpful. If e.g. the unzip command
is not found but it's available in a package, it would be very interesting
if the system could tell that the command is currently not available,
but installing a package would provide it.



USAGE

Just type command that is not installed on your system and handler should respond
with output similar to this:

The program 'blender' can be found in the following package:
  * blender [ path: /usr/bin/blender, repository: zypp (factory) ]

Try: sudo zypper install blender

bash: blender: command not found



INSTALLATON

This feature should be automatically enabled when using openSUSE 11.1 or newer.
If it is not working you can follow these instructions to install it manually:

bash - add the following 3 lines to your ~/.bashrc file (current user only)
       or /etc/bash.bashrc.local (system-wide setting):

  if test -f /etc/bash_command_not_found; then
      . /etc/bash_command_not_found
  fi

zsh - add the following 3 lines to your ~/.zshrc file (current user only)

  if [ -f /etc/zsh_command_not_found ]; then
      . /etc/zsh_command_not_found
  fi
